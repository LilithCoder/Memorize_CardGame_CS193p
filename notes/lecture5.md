- Swift Demo Warmup!

    Access Control
- @ViewBuilder

    What exactly is that argument to ZStack, ForEach, GeometryReader, etc.?
- Shape

    What if I want to draw my own View rather than construct it from other Views?
- Animation

    Mobile app UIs look pretty bad without animation.
Luckily, in SwiftUI, animation (almost) comes for free!
- ViewModifier

    What exactly are functions like foregroundColor, font, padding, etc. doing?
